## BNPanel ##

The project will provide the next generation in Free hosting applications. It provides you, the webhoster, near complete automation on everything you want it to do.

BNPanel supports hosting plans, hosting addons, customers, servers, tickets, paid hosting, cPanel and **ISPConfig 3** integration, **multi language support** and more.

It comes from the lack of Free Software billing solution in tools like ISPconfig.

BNPanel is technically a fork of The Hosting Tool (THT), though we carefully resubmit all our patches upstream.
